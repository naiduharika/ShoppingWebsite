			<h2>Freaquently Asked Questions</h2>
			<p> You've got questions - we've got answers! Here's a few of the most common questions that we're asked.<br /><br /></p>

			<dl class="faq">
				<dt><b>Q: What brands do you carry?</b></dt>
				<dd><br />We work with industry insiders to design our own styles based on the season's biggest trends. We work with the makers of Marc Jacobs, Steve Madden, Aldo and Nine West to provide you with styles made from high quality materials.</dd>

				<dt><b><br />Q: How do you come up with your prices?</b></dt>
				<dd><br />Since we deal directly with the manufacturer in the bulk, we can actually forward our savings on to you! We offer almost all of our products at or lower than major retailers</dd>

				<dt><br /><b>Q: What is your exchange policy?</b></dt>
				<dd><br />Harika's Boutique strives to provide superior customer service and a quality shopping experience to all of our clients. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your selection, you can exchange it for another style or return it for a store credit. We accept returns up to 30 days from date of shipment for items that are in new, unused condition and have all of the original packaging intact.</dd>
